              To put it simply, it’s easy. It’s what I always envisioned “normal life” to be. We decided there was no reason to wait to spend forever together. He proposed on June
              24th, and we went to a local courthouse on July 14th. Some people probably think we’re crazy and that it was “too soon,”
              but I can’t

              explain the feeling of fate. I have never been happier. And not because he makes me happy, but because I am finally
              happy with myself. I took a girls trip to Zion National Park in June without having to worry about whether or not he
              would drink too much.

              In December 2016, my alcoholic gave me the gift of infidelity. Yes, I said gift. It was truly the best Christmas present I never knew I wanted. It was my final straw.
              And let me be very clear, I was devastated. I was in shock. Utterly and completely shattered. I wanted to run back to
              him so very badly. I was scared .

            </p>
            <p>
              The hardest part about ending that relationship was my fear of the unknown. I didn’t know what would happen next – with
              me, my two daughters, or with him. It was terrifying. To say that I finally accepted reality or trusted God’s plan would
              be a complete lie. The only thing I knew for sure was that I didn’t want to live like that anymore.

              The running class was scheduled to begin January 4, 2017. My relationship ended suddenly and unexpectedly on Dec 27. I really just wanted to lie in bed and
              cry on January 4th, but something made me get up and go. I had already committed to it and I was tired of my alcoholic boyfriend’s antics ruining

              my plans. I went faithfully twice a week until the race in early March. I finished my very first half marathon and felt a sense of pride for that
              accomplishment. My running coach was kind and professional.
